### About The Project
#### Things I Learned:
1. Mobile-first approach on web development.
2. Installing custom fonts.

#### Areas of improvement:
1. Utilizing responsive units (em, rem, percentages) for font size, width and height.
2. Creating a more diverse, multipage website as opposed to a webpage.

### Disclaimer
'Dough Daddies' is not at a real business, and not all coined on behalf of the construction and public display of this webpage, and by us. The resources I used, specifically the logo photoshop template, custom fonts installed, backgrounds, pictures, and the svg icons are only utilized for personal use, and not otherwise.
