This is a product landing page for a business plan my friends and I made during freshman year. I figured it was a pretty cool idea so I made a page for it.

'Dough Daddies' is not at all coined on behalf of the construction and public display of this webpage, and by us. The resources I used, specifically the logo photoshop template, custom fonts installed, backgrounds, pictures, and the svg icons will be properly credited below, and will definitely not be utilized for commercial use.
