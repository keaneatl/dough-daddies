  <h1 align="center">Dough Daddies: My First Product Landing Page</h1>
  <p align="center">
    <strong>This is a product landing page for a business plan my friends and I made during freshman year. I figured it was a pretty cool idea so I made a fully responsive webpage for it</strong>

## About The Project
### Made With
1. HTML
2. CSS
<i>Note: I made sure to only use pure HTML and CSS for this project for practice purposes</i>

### Things I Learned
1. Mobile-first approach on web development.
2. Installing custom fonts.

### Areas of improvement
1. Utilizing responsive units (em, rem, percentages) for font size, width and height.
2. Creating a more diverse, multipage website as opposed to a webpage.

## Disclaimer
'Dough Daddies' is not at a real business, and not all coined on behalf of the construction and public display of this webpage, and by us. The resources I used, specifically the logo photoshop template, custom fonts installed, backgrounds, pictures, and the svg icons are only utilized for personal use, and not otherwise.
