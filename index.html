                We are Dough Daddies, and we are a Filipino-Italian fusion bakery & restaurant. We firmly believe that dough is a canvas 
                for food of different art forms. The brand presents a rustic theme carried by class, creating an ecosystem and 
                environment of home and elegance. Our service is bound on 
                crafting food that makes you feel at home but also provclasse a sense of class, regardless of their race, religion, 
                color, creed, and sexual orientation. We firmly believe in breaking barriers and pushing for an environment where our 
                food and service radiates acceptance.

            This business accommodates all people of all ages regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation. 
            As people become more aware of our productsâ€™ exemplary taste and quality, and our sincere service,  we are welcoming 
            all types of people from every part of the Philippines, and even all around the world. With our diverse body of 
            customers we are of course keeping in mind all the people, and we mean everyone, we are well aware that through our 
            daily work of producing, baking, and making food, we will always end up with excess products. According to the World 
            Wildlife Fund-Philippines, In Metro Manila alone, there are an estimated 2,175 tons of food scraps that end up in 
            trash bins on a daily basis. Much of this wasted food comes from restaurants (Climate Change Commission (CCC), 2020). 
            Thus, instead of this perfectly good food coming to waste, it will be given to people who are in need, and are not 
            privileged enough to have food for the day. Meaning that our definition of customers will also extend to those people, 
            so we will serve not only our paying customers, but those who are also desperately in need.
